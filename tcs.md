The Royal Bengal tiger is one of the majestic creatures of the world. The typical male weighs about 300 kilograms and is about 8 to 10 feet tall, whereas the female weighs around 180 kilograms and is 8 to 9 feet in height. Despite its heavy body, this tiger can run at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour and also climb trees for its prey when necessary. The mangroves of Sunderbans being its habitat, the royal Bengal tiger is a great swimmer too!

The night vision of this tiger is six times that of humans and hearing is five times that of humans. Just like human fingerprints, each tiger has a unique pattern of stripes that does not match any other tigerâs. The tiger does not forget faces, its memory is stronger than most animals in the wild. Often portrayed as savage, this tiger is caring and protective towards its family. When a killing happens, the male tiger eats after the females and children have had their feast. Unlike humans, this endangered species of India loves to live in a companionless environment.

Read the following passage and answer the questions.

NOTE: After selecting your response to the sub question you must click the âSAVE AND NEXTâ button to move to the next sub question.

For decades, Western culture has been reluctant to assign an inherent value or a purpose to art--even as it continues to hold art in high esteem. Though we no longer seem comfortable saying so, our reverence for art must be founded on a timeless premise; that art is good for us. If we don't believe this, then our commitment in money, time and study--makes little sense. In what way might art be good for us?The answer, I believe, is that art is a therapeutic instrument. Its value lies in its capacity to exhort, console and guide us toward better versions of ourselves and to help us live more flourishing lives individually and collectively.

Resistance to such a notion is understandable today, since âtherapyâ has become associated with questionable, or at least unavailing methods of improving mental health. To say that art is therapeutic is not to suggest that it shares therapyâs methods but rather its underlying ambition. To help us to cope better with existence. While several predominant ways of thinking about art appear to ignore or reject the goal, their ultimate claim is therapeutic as well.

Art capacity to shock remains for some a strong source of some of its contemporary appeal. We are conscious that individually and collectively, we may grow complacent; art can be valuable when it disrupts or astonishes us. We are particularly in danger of forgetting the artificiality of certain norms. It was once taken for granted, for instance, that women should not be allowed to vote and that the study of ancient Greek should dominate the curricula of English schools. Itâs easy now to see that those arrangements were far from inevitable, they were open to change and improvement.

When Sebastian Errazuirz created dollar signs out of ordinary street markings in Manhattan, his idea was to jolt passers-by into a radical reconsideration of the role of Money in daily life- to shake us out of our unthinking devotion to commerce. 

**Question: The title that best suits for the passage is:**

Options:



1. Art: No longer Therapeutic
2. Art is Art
3. Define Art
4. What is Art for?

Several Companies have announced that they plan to continue the option of Working from home after the Pandemic. The reasons being greater flexibility in balancing work and family life and higher productivity due to time saved in commute to the workplace. For employers, this is a cost-effective option as the travel expenses are low and there is less need for office space. It is also believed that a home-officer has fewer distractions, thereby making the employee more efficient. 

On the contrary, it is observed that some employees may not be able to thrive in physically isolated environments as they need social interaction to keep up their motivation. 

While working from home-office provides increased flexibility for the work situation, it could provide less flexibility in terms of collaborative work. There is a greater need for structure, planning and clear communication in digital mode. Meetings need to be planned in detail. The digital modality does have a few restrictions especially pertaining to communication- related aspects of working. In the digital mode, making spontaneous and necessary changes related to processes or projects proves to be quite challenging.

The subtle, yet significating, drawback of working exclusively is the inability to pick up cues from the body language of colleagues, like we would, when we are in physical space together.

Question: What are the advantages for employers in a work-from-home duration?

Mental health can affect daily living, relationships, and physical health. Factors in people's lives, interpersonal connections, and biological factors can all contribute to mental health disruptions. Looking after mental health can preserve a personâs ability to enjoy life. Doing this involves reaching a balance between life activities, responsibilities, and efforts to achieve psychological resilience. Conditions such as stress, depression, and anxiety can all affect mental health and disrupt a personâs routine. Although mental health is in everyday use, many conditions that doctors recognise as psychological disorders have physical roots.

Mental health is about not only avoiding active conditions but also looking after ongoing wellness and happiness. Preserving and restoring mental health is crucial on an individual basis, as well as throughout different communities and societies the world over. In the United States, the National Alliance on Mental Illness estimates that almost 1 in 5 adults experience mental health problems each year. 

According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), in 2017, an estimated 11.2 million adults in the U.S., or about 4.5% of adults, had a severe psychological condition. Everyone has some risk of developing a mental health disorder, no matter their age, sex, income, or ethnicity. In the U.S. and much of the developed world, mental disorders are one of the leading causes of disability. Social and financial circumstances, biological factors, and lifestyle choices can all shape a personâs mental health. A large proportion of people with a mental health disorder have more than one condition at a time. It is important to note that good mental health depends on a delicate balance of factors and that several elements of life and the world at large can work together to contribute to disorders.

Question: What is understood by âmental health disruptionsâfrom the above paragraph?



1. Extreme illness of the mind and body
2. of the brain
3. Abnormal functioning of the mind
4. Lack of coordination between the brain and the other parts of the body

Question 45:

Read the following passage and answer the questions.

NOTE: After selecting your response to the sub question you must click the âSAVE AND NEXTâ button to move to the next sub question.

Mental health can affect daily living, relationships, and physical health. Factors in people's lives, interpersonal connections, and biological factors can all contribute to mental health disruptions. Looking after mental health can preserve a personâs ability to enjoy life. Doing this involves reaching a balance between life activities, responsibilities, and efforts to achieve psychological resilience. Conditions such as stress, depression, and anxiety can all affect mental health and disrupt a personâs routine. Although mental health is in everyday use, many conditions that doctors recognise as psychological disorders have physical roots.

Mental health is about not only avoiding active conditions but also looking after ongoing wellness and happiness. Preserving and restoring mental health is crucial on an individual basis, as well as throughout different communities and societies the world over. In the United States, the National Alliance on Mental Illness estimates that almost 1 in 5 adults experience mental health problems each year. 

According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), in 2017, an estimated 11.2 million adults in the U.S., or about 4.5% of adults, had a severe psychological condition. Everyone has some risk of developing a mental health disorder, no matter their age, sex, income, or ethnicity. In the U.S. and much of the developed world, mental disorders are one of the leading causes of disability. Social and financial circumstances, biological factors, and lifestyle choices can all shape a personâs mental health. A large proportion of people with a mental health disorder have more than one condition at a time. It is important to note that good mental health depends on a delicate balance of factors and that several elements of life and the world at large can work together to contribute to disorders.

What do you mean by the sentence, âMental health is about not only avoiding active conditions but also looking after ongoing wellness and happinessâ?



1. Mental health care is about treatment of active mental disruptions as well as general mental well-being
2. Mental health care is about looking after ongoing wellness and happiness on a day-to-day basis
3. Mental health care is not about taking care of mental disruptions but bodily diseases
4. Mental health care is about avoiding active mental disruptions only

## **Coding**

Question 1:

An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the given data below:

1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler)=v

2nd data, Total number of wheels = W

The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.

Example :

Input :

200  -> Value of V

540   -> Value of W

Output :

TW =130 FW=70

Explanation:

130+70 = 200 vehicles

(70*4)+(130*2)= 540 wheels

Constraints :

2&lt;=W

W%2=0

V&lt;W

Print âINVALID INPUTâ , if inputs did not meet the constraints.

The input format for testing 

The candidate has to write the code to accept two positive numbers separated by a new line.

First Input line - Accept value of V.

Second Input line- Accept value for W.

The output format for testing 

Written program code should generate two outputs, each separated by a single space character(see the example)

Additional messages in the output will result in the failure of test case

Solution in C++:

#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

 

int main()

{

    int v,w; cin>>v>>w;

    float x=((4*v)-w)/2;

    if((w&1) || w&lt;2 || w&lt;=v)

      {cout<&lt;"INVALID INPUT"; return 0;}

    cout<&lt;"TW="<&lt;x<&lt;" "<&lt;"FW="<&lt;v-x;

}

Solution in Python:

v=int(input())

w=int(input())

if (w&1)==1 or w&lt;2 or w&lt;=v:

    print("INVALID INPUT")

else:

    x=((4*v) -w)//2

    print("TW={0} FW={1}".format(x,v-x))

Solution in Java:

import java.util.*;

public class Solution

{

    public static void main(String[] args)

    {

             Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

             int v=sc.nextInt();

             int w=sc.nextInt();

             float res=((4*v)-w)/2;

             if(w>=2 && (w%2==0) && v&lt;w ) 

               System.out.println("TW= "+(int)(res)+" FW= "+(int)(v-res));

             else

                System.out.println("INVALID INPUT");

    }

}

Question 2:

Given a string S(input consisting) of â*â and â#â. The length of the string is variable. The task is to find the minimum number of â*â or â#â to make it a valid string. The string is considered valid if the number of â*â and â#â are equal. The â*â and â#â can be at any position in the string.

Note : The output will be a positive or negative integer based on number of â*â and â#â in the input string.

(*>#): positive integer

(#>*): negative integer

(#=*): 0

Example 1:

Input 1:

###***   -> Value of S

Output :

0           â number of * and # are equal 

Solution in C++:


```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string s;
    int a=0,b=0;
    getline(cin,s);
    for(auto i:s)
    if(i=='#') a++;
    else if(i=='*') b++;
    cout<<b-a;
}
```


Solution in Python:


```
s=input()
a=0
b=0
for i in s:
    if i=='*':
        a+=1
    elif i=='#':
        b+=1
print(a-b)
```


Solution in Java:

import java.util.*;

public class Solution

{

 	public static void main(String[] args)

 	{

        		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

        		String str=sc.next();

        		int count1=0,count2=0;

        		for(int i=0;i&lt;str.length();i++)

        		{

                 		if(str.charAt(i)=='*')

                        		count1++;

                 		else if(str.charAt(i)=='#')

                         		count2++;

        		}

        		System.out.println(count1-count2);

	}

}

Question 3:

There are 3 empty packets in the given set. These 3 empty packets represented as O should be pushed towards the end of the array

Example 1:

Input:

7  - Value of N

[4,5,0,1,0,0,5] - Element of arr[O] to arr[N-1],While input each element is separated by newline

Output:

4 5 1 9 5 0 0

Example 2:

Input:

6

â Value of N.

[6,0,1,8,0,2] - Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], While input each element is separated by newline

Output:

6 1 8 2 0 0

Solution in C++:


```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int n,j=0; cin>>n;
    int a[n]={0};
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        cin>>a[j];
        if(a[j]!=0) j++;
    }
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++) cout<<a[i]<<" ";
}
```


Solution in Python:


```
n=int(input())
j=0
L=[0 for i in range(n)]
for i in range(n):
    a=int(input())
    if a!=0:
        L[j]=a
        j+=1
for i in L:
    print(i,end=" ")
```


Solution in Java:

Question 4:

Joseph is learning digital logic subject which will be for his next semester. He usually tries to solve unit assignment problems before the lecture. Today he got one tricky question. The problem statement is âA positive integer has been given as an input. Convert decimal value to binary representation. Toggle all bits of it after the most significant bit including the most significant bit. Print the positive integer value after toggling all bitsâ.

Constraints :

1&lt;=N&lt;=100

Example 1:

Input :

10  -> Integer

Output :

5    -> result- Integer

Explanation:

Binary representation of 10 is 1010. After toggling the bits(1010), will get 0101 which represents â5â. Hence output will print â5â.

Solution in Java:

import java.util.*;

class Solution

{

 	public static void main(String[] args)

 	{

        		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

        		int no=sc.nextInt();

         		String bin="";

         		


    while(no!=0)

          		{

                 		bin=(no&1)+bin;

                 		no=no>>1;

          		}

           		bin=bin.replaceAll("1","2");

           		bin=bin.replaceAll("0","1");

           		bin=bin.replaceAll("2","0");

           		int res=Integer.parseInt(bin,2);

          		System.out.println(res);

  	}

}

Solution in C++


```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

int main()
{
    int n; cin>>n;
    int k=(1<<(int)floor(log2(n))+1)-1;
    cout<<(n^k);

k=(1<<int(math.log2(n))+1)-1
print(n^k)
```


Question 5:

Jack is always excited about sunday. It is favourite day, when he gets to play all day. And goes to cycling with his friends. 

So every time when the months starts he counts the number of sundays he will get to enjoy. Considering the month can start with any day, be it Sunday, Mondayâ¦. Or so on.

Count the number of Sunday jack will get within n number of days.

Example 1:

Input 

mon-> input String denoting the start of the month.

13  -> input integer denoting the number of days from the start of the month.

Output :

2    -> number of days within 13 days.

Explanation:

The month start with mon(Monday). So the upcoming sunday will arrive in next 6 days. And then next Sunday in next 7 days and so on.

Now total number of days are 13. It means 6 days to first sunday and then remaining 7 days will end up in another sunday. Total 2 sundays may fall within 13 days.

Solution in Java:

import java.util.*;

class Solution

{

	public static void main(String[] args)

	{

       		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

       		String str=sc.next();

       		int n=sc.nextInt();

       		String arr[]={"mon","tue,","wed","thu","fri","sat","sun"};

       		int i=0;

       		for(i=0;i&lt;arr.length;i++)

            		if(arr[i].equals(str))

                		break;

       		int res=1;

       		int rem=6-i;

       		n=n-rem;  	 

       		if(n>0)

          			res+=n/7;

       		System.out.println(res);

Question 13: Read the following passage and answer the questions.

NOTE: After selecting your response to the sub question you must click the âSAVE AND NEXTâ button to move to the next sub question.

There is no need to distinguish work from occupation. Work is understood to be a necessity that is done to sustain life in general and in particular, though occupation also contributes to one's subsistence but it takes effort and energy in tandem with oneâs willingness and requires continuous endeavour. To proletariat class, the need to work is significant, because it does not have to think about finding out the ways to release its energy. Since work brings palpable benefits, it does instil a sense of satisfaction. Hence, work should be seen as a means to achieve other ends but occupation is a goal itself, hence it should be agreeable and not done as drudgery.

But if the element of need is minimised, some works are akin to occupation. All works where artistic and imaginative faculties are to be employed such as writing, painting, playing or social service, the need is negligible and want is paramount. Because these people are elated at exploring the spontaneous creative energy and their doing so is the very reward of their work. The higher is the pleasure, the greater will be the satisfaction. But for a lot of people there should be an amalgamation of the pleasure of occupation and the necessity of work. They always prefer an employment path trodden for them to be a path finder.\

In earlier times, the responsibility of an economic system to give work was neglected because the entire system strived to make an enterprise to make only profit. But when the profit dwindled, the capacity also came down, hence the workers, who were associated with the costs of production, were hired when needed and laid off when not needed. They never demanded work as a basic right. The labour movement everywhere emerged mainly as a protest against treating the workers as commodities to be bought and sold without considering their needs as _________

What was the chief cause of labour movement?



1. A need to share the wealth of owners
2. A desire to increase productivity
3. A resentment against treating workers as commodities
4. A move to mobilise women for work

NOTE: After selecting your response to the sub question you must click the âSAVE AND NEXTâ button to move to the next sub question.

Some of the most striking images from the early days of the pandemic, when public health orders and lockdowns ground economies to a halt, were the arresting photos of the Himalayas, suddenly visible from across the northern India, as decades of unreleasing smog finally abated. Unbelievably, some locals glimpsed the immense mountain range for the first time in their lives.

Itâs never too late to clear things up. And the pandemic has revived a movement that its roots in the 18th century, when the word âsustainabilityâ was first coined (in German) to describe a new approach to forestry enabling a continual harvest of wood. Itâs a movement widely believed to have entered the mainstream with the 1987 Our Common Future report - a UN-backed initiative, overseen by Norwayâs then prime minister. Gro Harlem Brundtland, which laid out an ambitious pathway towards a âsustainable economyâ. This left us with the enduringly relevant definition of sustainability as âdevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needsâ.

Historians of the future will see the last year as a major turning point in world history, and perhaps even the dawn of a new era. The enforced economic slowdown of the pandemic, which inadvertently drove down emissions and induced simple living (gardening, sour dough, local hiking), provides new momentum for calibrating cultural values and changing the very trajectory of our globalised industrial society

In many ways, sustainability has been a success story. It has driven an unprecedented increase in renewable energy, revived local and organic food markets, led to the start of the phasing out of single-use plastics, catalysed circular economy systems and sparked an unprecedented normalisation and institutionalisation of sustainability within governments, NGOs, corporations and universities, making many organisations less wasteful, more energy-efficient and more committed to the âtriple bottom lineâ, which means weighing equally social, environmental and financial wellbeing. The rise of theories such as Kate Raworthâs âdoughnut economicsâ, adopted by the city of Amsterdam, offer exciting new ways for such ideas to be further adapted**.**

Which of the following is NOT a positive outcome of sustainability?



1. Promotion of local food without harmful chemicals
2. Rise in renewable energy
3. Ban on the production of fossil fuel
4. Cut in the use of harmful synthetic material

## **Coding**

Question 1:

A parking lot in a mall has RxC number of parking spaces. Each parking psace will either be  empty(0) or full(1). The status (0/1) of a parking space is represented as the element of the matrix. The task is to find index of the prpeinzta row(R) in the parking lot that has the most of the parking spaces full(1).

Note :

RxC- Size of the matrix

Elements of the matrix M should be only 0 or 1.

Example 1:

Input :

3   -> Value of R(row)

3	-> value of C(column)

[0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1] -> Elements of the array M[R][C] where each element is separated by new line.

Output :

3  -> Row 3 has maximum number of 1's

Example 2:

input :

4 -> Value of R(row)

3 -> Value of C(column)

[0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1] -> Elements of the array M[R][C]

Output :

4  -> Row 4 has maximum number of 1âs

  	}

}

Question 2:

Given an integer array Arr of size N the task is to find the count of elements whose value is greater than all of its prior elements.

Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the count of the result.

For example,

Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}

As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result.

8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all of its previous elements.

Since total of  3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.

Hence the output = 3.

 Example 1:

Input 

5 -> Value of N, represents size of Arr

7-> Value of Arr[0]

4 -> Value of Arr[1]

8-> Value of Arr[2]

2-> Value of Arr[3]

9-> Value of Arr[4]

Output :

3

Example 2:

5   -> Value of N, represents size of Arr

3  -> Value of Arr[0]

4 -> Value of Arr[1]

5 -> Value of Arr[2]

8 -> Value of Arr[3]

9 -> Value of Arr[4]

Output : 

5

Question 3:

Airport security officials have confiscated several item of the passengers at the security check point. All the items have been dumped into a huge box (array). Each item possesses a certain amount of risk[0,1,2]. Here, the risk severity of the items represent an array[] of N number of integer values. The task here is to sort the items based on their levels of risk in the array. The risk values range from 0 to 2.

Example :

Input :

7  -> Value of N

[1,0,2,0,1,0,2]-> Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], while input each element is separated by new line.

Output :

0 0 0 1 1 2 2  -> Element after sorting based on risk severity 

Example 2:

input : 10  -> Value of N 

[2,1,0,2,1,0,0,1,2,0] -> Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], while input each element is separated by a new line.

Output : 

0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2  ->Elements after sorting based on risk severity.

Explanation:

In the above example, the input is an array of size N consisting of only 0âs, 1âs and 2s. The output is a sorted array from 0 to 2 based on risk severity.

Solution in Java:

Question 4:

Let x be the least number which when divided by 12,15,18,20,27 and 30, the remainder in each case is 1 and x is a multiple of 47. The sum of the digits of x is:

Options:



1. 13
2. 11
3. 9
4. 10

Ans:- d) 10

LCM of 12,15,18,20,27, 30 is 540 

Number should be divisible by 47 if we multiply k by 540 and add 1 then the number is divisible by 47

540k + 1/ 47

Put value of k as 1,2 

For k=2 

540 * 2 +1 = 1081 which is divisible by 47

1081/47=23

So the digit is 1081 

Addition of digits = 10

**Question 21:**Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow

NOTE: After selecting your response to the sub question, you must click âSAVE AND NEXTâ button to move to the next sub question

**Most** of the earth is covered with undrinkable water. Oceans cover 70% of Earthâs surface and account for about 97% of all water. The average salt content of ocean water is 35 parts per thousand, which is about 120 million tons of salt per cubic mile of seawater.

Where does all the salt come from? It comes mostly from the land. As rain forms and falls through the air, it accumulates carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and becomes slightly acidic. It then flows over the land, necrociting rocks and picking up small amounts of salt and other dissolved minerals. At this point, the water is still fresh and drinkable. Once this water flows into the ocean, some of the dissolved minerals are removed from it by biological processes, but the salt remains. Additional salt is contributed by underwater hydrothermal and volcanic activity.

The idea that salt was gradually deposited in the sea by rivers was first suggested by Edmond Halley. He proposed that the salinity of seawater could be used to determine the age of the ocean. Based on this theory Physicist Johnny Jolly came up with an estimate of 90 million years, which was later calculated to be 4 billion years with the use of advanced technology. Haileyâs scheme had a flow. He failed to account for the fact that some sea salt gets concealed in the form of mineral deposits on the seafloor.

Question: Why was John Jollyâs estimate of the age of the oceans revised?

Options



1. Because the new estimate was calculated after a substantial time
2. Because John Jollyâs estimate accounted for the salt deposited on the seafloor
3. Because the precision of advanced technology used yieldied a far greater age
4. Because John Joly did not follow Haileyâs scheme to perform calculations.

## **Coding**

**Question 1:**

A party has been organised on cruise. The party is organised for a limited time(T). The number of guests entering (E[i]) and leaving (L[i]) the party at every hour is represented as elements of the array. The task is to find the maximum number of guests present on the cruise at any given instance within T hours.

Example 1:

Input :

5    -> Value of T

[7,0,5,1,3]  -> E[], Element of E[0] to E[N-1], where input each element is separated by new line 

[1,2,1,3,4]   -> L[], Element of L[0] to L[N-1], while input each element is separate by new line.

Output :

8     -> Maximum number of guests on cruise at an instance.

Explanation:

1st hour:

Entry : 7 Exit: 1

No. of guests on ship : 6

2nd hour :

Entry : 0 Exit : 2

No. of guests on ship : 6-2=4

Hour 3:

Entry: 5 Exit: 1

No. of guests on ship : 4+5-1=8

Hour 4:

Entry : 1 Exit : 3

No. of guests on ship : 8+1-3=6

Hour 5:

Entry : 3 Exit: 4

No. of guests on ship: 6+3-4=5

Hence, the maximum number of guests within 5 hours is 8.

Example 2:

Input:

4  -> Value of T

[3,5,2,0]   -> E[], Element of E[0] to E[N-1], where input each element is separated by new line.

[0,2,4,4]    -> L[], Element of L[0] to L[N-1], while input each element in separated by new line

Output:

6

Cruise at an instance

Explanation:

Hour 1:

Entry: 3 Exit: 0

No. of guests on ship: 3

Hour 2:

Entry : 5 Exit : 2

No. of guest on ship: 3+5-2=6

Hour 3:

Entry : 2 Exit: 4

No. of guests on ship: 6+2-4= 4

Hour 4:

Entry: 0  Exit : 4

No. of guests on ship : 4+0-4=0

Hence, the maximum number of guests within 5 hours is 6.

The input format for testing

The candidate has to write the code to accept 3 input.

First input- Accept  value for number of T(Positive integer number)

Second input- Accept T number of values, where each value is separated by a new line.

Third input- Accept T number of values, where each value is separated by a new line.

The output format for testing

The output should be a positive integer number or a message as given in the problem statement(Check the output in Example 1 and Example 2)

Constraints:

1&lt;=T&lt;=25

0&lt;= E[i] &lt;=500

0&lt;= L[i] &lt;=500

**Solution in Java:**

import java.util.*;

class Solution

{

         public static void main(String[] args)

         {

              Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

              int t=sc.nextInt();

              int e[]=new int[t];

              int l[]=new int[t];

              

              for(int i=0;i&lt;t;i++)

                  e[i]=sc.nextInt();

 

              for(int i=0;i&lt;t;i++)

                   l[i]=sc.nextInt();

 

              int max=0,sum=0;

              for(int i=0;i&lt;t;i++)

              {

                     sum+=e[i]-l[i];

                     max=Math.max(sum,max);

              }

              System.out.println(max);

         }

}

**Question 2:**

At a fun fair, a street vendor is selling different colours of balloons. He sells N number of different colours of balloons (B[]). The task is to find the colour (odd) of the balloon which is present odd number of times in the bunch of balloons.

Note:

If there is more than one colour which is odd in number, then the first colour in the array which is present odd number of times is displayed. The colours of the balloons can all be either upper case or lower case in the array. If all the inputs are even in number, display the message âAll are evenâ.

Example 1:

7  -> Value of N

[r,g,b,b,g,y,y]  -> B[] Elements B[0] to B[N-1], where input each element is sepÄrated by á¹ew line.

Output :

r -> [r,g,b,b,g,y,y]  -> ârâ colour balloon is present odd number of times in the bunch.

Explanation:

From the input array above:

r: 1 balloon 

g: 2 balloons

b:  2 balloons

y : 2 balloons 

Hence , r is only the balloon which is odd in number.

Example 2:

Input:

10 -> Value of N

[a,b,b,b,c,c,c,a,f,c] -> B[], elements B[0] to B[N-1] where input each element is separated by new line.

Output :

b-> âbâ colour balloon is present odd number of times in the bunch.

Explanation:

From the input array above:

a: 2 balloons

b: 3 balloons 

c: 4 balloons 

f: 1 balloons 

Here, both âbâ and âfâ have odd number of balloons. But âbâ colour balloon occurs first.

Hence , b is the output.

The input format for testing

The candidate has to write the code to accept: 3 input 

First input: Accept value for number of N(Positive integer number).

Second Input : Accept N number of character values (B[]), where each value is separated by a new line.

The output format for testing

The output should be a single literal (Check the output in example 1 and example 2)

Constraints:

3&lt;=N&lt;=50

B[i]={{a-z} or {A-Z}}

Question 12:  Read the following passage and answer  the questions that follow:

Fisheries are an important source of food,nutrition,employment and income in India. The sector provides livelihood to about 16 million fishers and fish farmers at the primary level and almost twice the number along the value chain. Fish being an affordable and rich source of animal protein, is one of the healthiest options to mitigate hunger and malnutrition. The sector has immense potential to more than double the fishers farmers incomes,as envisioned by the government. Commencing as a purely traditional activity, fisheries have now transformed into a commercial enterprise. The share of the fisheries sector in the total GDP increased from 0.04% in 1950-51 to 1.03% in 2017-18, the sector has been one of the major contributors of foreign exchange earnings with India being one of the leading seafood exporting nations in the world. The rapid increase in the growth of seafood exports has been mainly due to the boom in brackish water aquaculture. India has rich and diverse fisheries resources ranging from deep seas to lakes, ponds, rivers and more than 10% of the global biodiversity in terms of fish and shellfish species. The utilized and underutilized vast and varied inland resources offer great opportunities for livelihood and development and ushering economic prosperity.

The government is trying to promote fisheries because it has the potential to:



1. Breed good quality fish in its rivers and brackish lakes.
2. Provide a means of livelihood to millions of fisherman
3. Generate employment opportunities for many
4. Earn foreign exchange through export of sea food.

Question 16:

**Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow.**


According to some natural scientists and economists, one potential step to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change would be the widespread adoption of all electric vehicles (EVs), which can be powered by electricity generated by sunlight, wind, and water. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, transportation emits more greenhouse gases than any other sector in the US, because of its dependence on fossil fuels. Thus, emissions can be dramatically reduced by widespread adoption of EVs. For this reason, manufacturing and sales of EVs have been increasing in recent years. BUT these sales are slow to pick up.


This slow adoption could be due to many reasons .For instance, most people who might buy an EV already own a car, so purchasing another one may not be a wise option .Such consumer durable replacement decisions become barriers to the adoption of new technologically innovative products.


Some consumers become so attached to their current gasoline-powered cars, that they become reluctant to replace them exhibiting behavior of loss aversion. There are others who may be risk averse- uncertain of their evaluations of the expected benefits


Functionality concerns such as the charging capacity of EV batteries, or the miles-per-charge of such vehicles could also slow down purchase decisions.

**Ques: The expression âLoss Aversionâ as used in para 3 implies**

**Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow**


Girls have regularly outshone boys in board exams And a tectonic shift may be underway in India's higher education as well-women's gross enrolment ratio is now higher than that of men. This is across BA, BSc, MPhil and MBBS programmes. Two factors may be at work here Average incomes have risen, even though the rate of increase has probably slowed recently And the transformative effect education can have on young women's lives has become more and more apparent The 2017-18 Economic Survey had highlighted that several gender indicators are much more responsive to wealth in India, as compared to other countries. But, and here's the bad news, there are also stubborn outliers-women's employment is a notable one.


Indian women's labour force participation rate is lower than Pakistan and Afghanistan's according to a 2020 World Bank report. The Survey had noted that the trend started last decade 36% of women were employed in 2005-06, 24% in 2015-16 The income effect higher average family incomes leading to withdrawal of women from labour force-is a reason The pandemic has taken added tolls. The first Covid wave hit women's jobs disproportionately. The lockdown experience of working urban women was made more painful by persisting gender segregation of household works. The second wave seems to have hit rural women's employment.


**Which of these statements is NOT supported by the passage?**



1. Higher income level generates transformative effect of education on women
2. Average income rate level has not accelerated lately
3. Higher income level leads to more women receiving education
4. Higher income level causes less participation of women in the work force

## **Coding**

Question - 1:

A supermarket maintains a pricing format for all its products. A value N is printed on each product. When the scanner reads the value N on the item, the product of all the digits in the value N is the price of the item. The task here is to design the software such that given the code of any item N the product (multiplication) of all the digits of value should be computed(price).

Example 1:

Input :

5244 -> Value of N

Output : \
160 -> Price 

Explanation:

From the input above 

Product of the digits 5,2,4,4

5*2*4*4= 160

Hence, output is 160.

Solution in C++:


```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string s; cin>>s;
    int p=1;
    for(auto i:s) p*=(i-'0');
    cout<<p;
}
```


Solution in Python:


```
n=input()
p=1
for i in n:
    p*=int(i)
print(p)
```


Solution in Java:

import java.util.*;

class Solution

{

    public static void main(String[] args)

    {

          Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

          int n=sc.nextInt();

          int res=1;

        

          while(n>0)

          {

                res=res*(n%10);

                n=n/10;

           }

            System.out.println(res);

    }

}

**Question 2:**

The task is to encrypt the given string(str1) as per the ciphers given in the format above.

Note : String cannot have any special characters, space, number or any uppercase latter.

Example 1:

Input :

word -> value of str1

Output:

btwi  -> after changing the character with the ciphers

w  o   r   d

|     |   |    |

b   t   w   i

Hence the output if btwi

Example 2:

Input :

reply  -> Value of str1

Output : 

wjuqd

**Solution in Java:**

import java.util.*;

class Solution

{

     public static void main(String[] args)

     {

            Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

            String str=sc.next();

            String res="";

Question 22:

Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was incorporated in May 1927. Its goal was to achieve outstanding achievements in the different branches of film production, thus improving the quality of all aspects of motion picture production.

The art director of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Studios Cedric Gibbons sketched the iconic statuette of the award. It was the figure of a knight holding a sword standing on a base wrapped with a film reel. Los Angeles sculptor George Stanley realised this design in three dimensions.

The statuette is thirteen and a half inches tall and weighs right and a half pounds. The design of the statuette has never changed but the size of the base was changed in 1945 and remains the same since then.

Every January, these golden statuette are hand-cast in bronze and then electroplated with 24 karat gold in Brooklyn. The first of the Academy Awards was given away on 16th May 1929. SInce then, over five thousand statuettes have been presented.

Officially named the Academy Award of Merit, the statuette is better known by its nickname, Oscar. Sources have it that the Academy librarian and later executive director Margaret Herrick said the statuette resembled her Uncle Oscar. Thereafter, the Academy staff began referring to it as Oscar and the name stuck!

Which of the following best describes the purpose of incorporating the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences?



1. To honour outstanding achievements in the different branches of film production
2. To give away more than three thousand Academy Awards of Merit statuettes
3. To encourage art studies in Brooklyn to make bronze statuettes and electroplate them in 24-karat gold
4. To encourage art directors and sculptors to design statuettes for awards

Question 25:

A decadeâs worth of telescope observations of the sun has revealed a startling mystery: Gamma rays, the highest frequency waves of light, radiate from our nearest star seven times more abundantly than expected. Stranger still, despite this extreme excess of gamma rays overall, the narrow bandwidth of frequencies is curiously absent.

The surplus light, the gap in the spectrum, and other surprises about the solar gamma-ray signal potentially point to unknown features of the sunâs magnetic field, or more exotic physics. âItâs amazing that we were so spectacularly wrong about something we should understand really well: the sun,â said Brian Fields, a particle astrophysicist at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

The unexpected signal has emerged in data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, a NASA observatory that scans the sky from its outpost in low-Earth orbit. As more Fermi data have accrued, revealing the spectrum of gamma rays coming from the sun in ever-greater detail, the puzzles have only proliferated. âWe just kept finding surprising things,â said Annika Peter of Ohio State University, a co-author of a recent white paper summarizing several years of findings about the solar gamma-ray signal. âItâs definitely the most surprising thing Iâve ever worked on.â

Not only is the gamma-ray signal far stronger than a decades-old theory predicts; it also extends to much higher frequencies than predicted, and it inexplicably varies across the face of the sun and throughout the 11-year solar cycle. Then thereâs the gap, which researchers call a âdipâ â a lack of gamma rays with frequencies around 10 trillion trillion hertz. âThe dip just defies all logic,â said Tim Linden, a particle astrophysicist at Ohio State who helped analyze the signal. Fields, who wasnât involved in the work, said, âTheyâve done a great job with the data, and the story it tells is really kind of amazing.â

## **Coding**

Question 1:

An English school teacher is teaching how to build sentences for kindergarten students. She starts by teaching two words in a sentence, then 3 words and so on. The next step is that she asks the students to find which word in the sentence they have made has the maximum number of alphabets. The task here is to write program to find the longest word in each input sentence(str).

Note :

The sentence can consist of uppercase, lowercase alphabets, special characters and numbers.

Example 1:

Input :

Knowledge is the greatest gift   -> Value of str

Output :

9

Explanation:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Word
   </td>
   <td>No. of characters
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Knowledge
   </td>
   <td>9
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Is
   </td>
   <td>2
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>The
   </td>
   <td>3
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Greatest
   </td>
   <td>8
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Gift
   </td>
   <td>4
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


From the above table, we can derive the word with highest number of characters is knowledge.

Hence , output is 9.

Example 2:

Inpout :

11223##%%5566778899 Saturn V rocketâs  first stage carries 203,400 gallons (770,000 litres) of kerosene fuel

Output :

19  -> word with max characters

Expalantion:

Longest word in the sentence is 

11223##%%5566778899

Hence, output is 19.

The Input format for testing 

The candidate has to write the code to accept one input(s)

First Input -

Accept value for number of str which is a string of characters 

The output format for testing 

The output should be a positive integer number.

Question 2:

An international round table conference will be held in india. Presidents from all over the world representing their respective countries will be attending the conference. The task is to find the possible number of ways(P) to make the N members sit around the circular table such that.

The president and prime minister of India will always sit next to each other.

Example 1:

Input :

4   -> Value of N(No. of members)

Output : 

12  -> Possible ways of seating the members

Explanation:

2  members should always be next to each other. 

So, 2 members can be in 2!ways

Rest of the members can be arranged in (4-1)! ways.(1 is subtracted because the previously selected two members will be considered as single members now).

So total possible ways 4 members can be seated around the circular table 2*6= 12.

Hence, output is 12.

Example 2:

Input:

10  -> Value of N(No. of members)

Output :

725760 -> Possible ways of seating the members 

Explanation:

2 members should always be next to each other.

So, 2 members can be in 2! ways 

Rest of the members can be arranged in (10-1)! Ways. (1 is subtracted because the previously selected two members will be considered as a single member now).

So, total possible ways 10 members can be seated around a round table is 

2*362880 = 725760 ways.

Hence, output is 725760.

The input format for testing

The candidate has to write the code to accept one input 

First input - Accept value of number of N(Positive integer number)

Question 20:

Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow.

NOTE: After selecting your response to the sub question, you must click âSAVE AND NEXTâ button to move to the next sub question.

Information Processing Theory is cognitive theory that focuses on how the information is encoded into our memory. The theory describes how our brains filter information, from what weâre paying attention to in the present moment, to what gets stored in our short-term or working memory and ultimately into our long-term memory.

The premise of Information Processing Theory is that creating a long-term memory is something that happens in stages;first we perceive something through our sensory memory, which is everything we can see, hear, feel or taste in a given moment; our short-term memory is what we use to remember things for very short periods, like a phone number; and long-term memory is stored permanently in our brains.

Developed  by American psychologists including Goerge Miller in the 1950s, Information Processing Theory has in recent years compared the human brain to a computer. The âinputâ is the information we give to the computer- or to our brains- while the CPU is likened to our short-term memory, and the hard-drive is our long-term memory.

Our cognitive processes filter information, deciding what is important enough to âsaveâ from our sensory memory to our short-term memory, and ultimately to encode into our long-term memory, imagining, problem-solving, our sense of judgement, and planning.

 Which of the following about the human brain is TRUE?

Options:



1. It manages the input and shifts what it wants to store.
2. It carefully stores all the materials it is exposed to.
3. All human brains store the same information in the same way.
4. It produces the input in the same format when asked to.

According to the passage, âInformationâ relates to______________

Options:



1. that which we watch in the television shows.
2. something we read about in the newspaper.
3. something we are told by our family or friends.
4. what we see,hear and observe around us.

Answer: D

Question 22:

Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow.

NOTE: After selecting your response to the sub question, you must click the âSAVE AND NEXTâ button to move to the next sub question.

Information Processing Theory is cognitive theory that focuses on how the information is encoded into our memory. The theory describes how our brains filter information, from what weâre paying attention to in the present moment, to what gets stored in our short-term or working memory and ultimately into our long-term memory.

The premise of Information Processing Theory is that creating a long-term memory is something that happens in stages;first we perceive something through our sensory memory, which is everything we can see, hear, feel or taste in a given moment; our short-term memory is what we use to remember things for very short periods, like a phone number; and long-term memory is stored permanently in our brains.

Developed  by American psychologists including Goerge Miller in the 1950s, Information Processing Theory has in recent years compared the human brain to a computer. The âinputâ is the information we give to the computer- or to our brains- while the CPU is likened to be our short-term memory, and the hard-drive is our long-term memory.

Our cognitive processes filter information, deciding what is important enough to âsaveâ from our sensory memory to our short-term memory, and ultimately to encode into our long-term memory, imagining, problem-solving, our sense of judgement, and planning.

Question 1:

Ab âNâ number of customers are waiting at a restaurant that is recently opened. After every âMâ minutes , a new customer arrives at the restaurant. Due to the huge crowd, customers have to wait for their table at the restaurant. Only one customer is allowed at a time. The manager at the reception desk asks each customer to wait for âXâ minutes to get their table. The task is to calculate the duration (in minutes) the last customer arrived needs to wait.

Example 1:

5      Value of N

3      Value of M

10     Value of X

Output :

28

Explanation:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Customers
   </td>
   <td>Customer 1
   </td>
   <td>Customer 2
   </td>
   <td>Customer 3
   </td>
   <td>Customer 4

   </td>
   <td>14
   </td>
   <td>21
   </td>
   <td>28
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


The lasá¹­ customer arrives at the restauraá¹t at the 12th minute, and he gets a table at 40 minutes. So, the total duration the last customer waited to get a table is 40-12=28 minutes.

Hence, the output is 28.

Example 2:

Input :

3     Value of N

5     Value of M

5    Value of X

Output :

0

Explanation:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Customers
   </td>
   <td>Customer 1
   </td>
   <td>Customer 2
   </td>
   <td>Customer 3
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Arrival time
   </td>
   <td>0

   <td>Waiting time
   </td>
   <td>0
   </td>
   <td>0
   </td>
   <td>0
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


The last customer arrives at the restaurant at the 10th minute, and he gets a table after 10 minutes. So, the total duration the last customer waited to get a table is 10-10=0. I.e. no need to wait.

Hence , the output is 0.

Question 2:

A furnishing company is manufacturing a new collection of curtains. The curtains are of two colors aqua(a) and black (b). The curtains color is represented as a string(str) consisting of aâs and bâs of length N. Then, they are packed (substring) into L number of curtains in each box. The box with the maximum number of âaquaâ (a) color curtains is labeled. The task here is to find the number of âaquaâ color curtains in the labeled box.

Note :

If âLâ is not a multiple of N, the remaining number of curtains should be considered as a substring too. In simple words, after dividing the curtains in sets of âLâ, any curtains left will be another set(refer example 1)

Example 1:

Input :

bbbaaababa -> Value of str

3    -> Value of L

Output:

3   -> Maximum number of aâs

Explanation:

From the input given above.

Dividing the string into sets of 3 characters each 

Set 1: {b,b,b}

Set 2: {a,a,a}

Set 3: {b,a,b}

Set 4: {a} -> leftover characters also as taken as another set

Among all the sets, Set 2 has more number of aâs. The number of aâs in set 2 is 3.

Hence, the output is 3.

Example 2:

Input :

abbbaabbb -> Value of str

5   -> Value of L

Output:

2   -> Maximum number of aâs

Explanation:

From the input given above,

Dividing the string into sets of 5 characters each.

Set 1: {a,b,b,b,b}

Set 2: {a,a,b,b,b}

Among both the sets, set 2 has more number of aâs. The number of aâs in set 2 is 2.

Hence, the output is 2.

Constraints:

1&lt;=L&lt;=10

1&lt;=N&lt;=50

The input format for testing 

The candidate has to write the code to accept two inputs separated by a new line.

First input- Accept string that contains character a and b only

Second input- Accept value for N(Positive integer number)

The output  format for testing

The output should be a positive integer number of print the message(if any) given in the problem statement.(Check the output in Example 1, Example 2).

Solution in Java:

import java.util.*;

class Solution

{

       public static void main(String[] args)

       {

               Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

               String str=sc.next();

               int n=sc.nextInt();

               int max=0,count=0;

               for(int i=0;i&lt;str.length();i++)

               {

                       if(i%n==0)

                       {

                          max=Math.max(count,max); 

                          count=0;

                       }

                       if(str.charAt(i)=='a')

                             count++;

                }

                max=Math.max(count,max);

Social Networking sites allow users to connect to each other- the users have to first create their personal information profiles before they can invite their friends or colleagues to access their profiles and have instant  message exchanges. These personal profiles can compromise information, photograph and audio/video files. In an age of increasingly sophisticated technology, large volumes of online personal content pose a big threat to userâs privacy. With the flooding of digital cameras and smartphones that have advanced applications, uploading of personal data, photos and Videos on the web has become childâs play. Privacy has thus become a concern with many as multimedia applications are capable of making public so much personal information without consent or approval. 

According to Forrester Research, 75% of internet surfers use social networks. The official site of facebook claims that the network added more than 210 crore subscribers in just one year, which is almost the combined population of UK (63 crore) France (65 crore) and Germany (82 crore). It may sound bizarre but it is true that every minute of the day, 40200 tweets are sent, 50 hours of video are uploaded to youTube and 50,000 apps are downloaded from the App store, and around 3 lakh dollars are spent by consumers on online shopping. Many users post highly personal details of their lives on social networks. It includes their real names, addresses, family details,  contact numbers, availability, likes and dislikes, hobbies and relationships. Users are naive if they believe their postings on social media are private and safe between them and their recipients. In reality once information is posted to social networks, the user loses their ownership. It will not be offline again and remain for millions of eyes. If this is hard to believe, try and Google yourself, Chances are that you will get the shock of your life to see details you had never, ever wanted to go public.

The old civilisation of India was a concrete unity of man side developments in art, architecture, literature, religion, morales and science, so far as it was understood in those days. But the most important achievement of Indian thought was philosophy. It was regarded as the goal of all the highest practical and theoretical activities, and it indicated the point of unity amidst all the apparent diversities which the complex growth culture over a vast area inhabited by different peoples produced.

It is not in the history of foreign invasions, in the rise of independent kingdoms at different times, in the empires of this or that great **monarch ** that the unity of India is to be sought. It is essentially one of the spiritual aspirations and obedience to the law of the spirit, which were regarded as superior to everything else, and it has outlived all the political changes through which India passed.

The Greeks,the Huns,the Scythians, the Pathans and the Mughals, who occupied the land and controlled the political machinery, never ruled the minds of the people. The political events were like hurricanes or the changes of seasons, mere phenomena of a natural or physical order which never affected the spiritual integrity of Hindu culture. If after a passage of some centuries, India is again going to become creative, it is mainly on account of this fundamental unity of her progress and civilisation and not for anything that she may borrow from other countries.

At the time when the ocean is threatened by climate change and pollution, coastlines are ending and entire species of marine life are at risk of extinction, the role  of oceanographers has become more important than it ever was.

One of the most critical branches of oceanography today is biological oceanography. It is the study of oceanâs plants and animals and their interactions with the marine environment. But oceanography is not just study and research. It is also about using that information to help leaders make smart choices about policies that affect ocean health. Lessons learned through oceanography affect the ways humans use the sea for transportation, food, energy, water and much more.

Today oceanographers are exploring a range of subjects as wide as the ocean itself. 

For example, fishermen with the Northwest Atlantic Marine Alliance (NAMA) are working with oceanographers to better understand how pollutants are reducing fish populations and posing health risks to consumers of the fish.

Other teams are investigating how melting sea ice is changing the feed migration patterns of whales that populate the oceanâs coldest region.

Visible impact of climate change on ocean includes all of the following EXCEPT_______

Options:



1. Melting of sea ice
2. Extinction of marine life
3. Studies in biological oceanography
4. Erosion of coastlines

The resultant is also a single digit that is yet to be deciphered. The task here is to find the single-digit sum of the given number âNâ by repeating the action âRâ number of times.

If the value of âRâ is 0, print the output as â0â.

Example 1:

Input :

99 -> Value of N

3  -> Value of R

Output :

9  -> Possible ways to fill the cistern.

Explanation:

Here, the number N=99



1. Sum of the digits N: 9+9 = 18
2. Repeat step 2 âRâ times i.e. 3 tims  (9+9)+(9+9)+(9+9) = 18+18+18 =54
3. Add digits of 54 as we need a single digit 5+4

Hence , the output is 9.

Example 2:

Input :

1234   -> Value of N

2      -> Value of R

Output :

2  -> Possible ways to fill the cistern

Explanation:

Here, the number N=1234



1. Sum of the digits of N: 1+2+3+4 =10
2. Repeat step 2 âRâ times i.e. 2 times  (1+2+3+4)+(1+2+3+4)= 10+10=20
3. Add digits of 20 as we need a single digit. 2+0=2

Hence, the output is 2.

Constraints:

0&lt;N&lt;=1000

0&lt;=R&lt;=50

The Input format for testing

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string s; cin>>s;
    int n,sum=0; cin>>n;
    for(auto i:s) sum+=(i-'0');
    sum*=n;
    s=to_string(sum);
    while(s.length()>1)
    {
        sum=0;
        for(auto i:s) sum+=(i-'0');
        s=to_string(sum);
    }
    cout<<s;
}
```


**Solution in Python:**

Question 2:

There are âNâ number of houses in a village. Each house requires a voltage âVâ volts of electricity to power up their home appliances. In this context, the houses are arranged in the form of a matrix (row* columns) where âNâ is the order of the matrix. The amount of voltage supplied to each house is calculated as current(i)*voltage(r) where âiâ is the row number and ârâ is the column number. When the voltage supplied to the house (i*r) matches the value âVâ, the appliances in the house can work. The task here is to find the number of houses whose voltage value(i*r) is the same as âVâ. If none of the houseâs value matches display a message âNO POWERâ.

Example 1:

Input :

5      Value of N i.e. rows, columns=5

15    Value of V

Output :

2      number of houses whose i*r value matches 

Explanation:

From the inputs given above

i=5, r=5

The below table represents values (i*r)


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>i/j
   </td>
   <td>1
   </td>
   <td>2

   <td>25
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


From the table above, we can deduce that the value v=15 occurs only in the houses(i,r)

(3,5) (5,3)

Hence, the output is 2.

Example 2:

Input :

3    Value of N i.e. rows=3, columns=3

10   Value of V

Output : \
NO POWER   number of houses where i*r value matches V

Explanation:

From the inputs given above 

i=3 r=3

The below table represents values (i*r)


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>i/j
   </td>
   <td>1
   </td>
   <td>2
   </td>
   <td>3

   <td>3
   </td>
   <td>3
   </td>
   <td>6
   </td>
   <td>9
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


From the table above, we can deduce that the value v=10 doesnât match with the voltage in any of the houses.

Hence, the output is NO POWER

Constraints:

0&lt;N&lt;=50

0&lt;V&lt;=250

The input format for testing 

The candidate has to write the code to accept 2 inputs 

First input : Accept value for N (Positive integer number)

Second input : Accept value for V(positive integer number)

The output format for testing 

The output should be a positive integer number or print the message (if any) given in the problem statement. (Check the output in Example 1, Example 2).

Question 15:  Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow.

NOTE: After selecting your response to the sub question, you must click the âSAVE AND NEXTâ button to move to the next sub question.

Dr. Jane Goodallâs journey to Gombe many years ago to study wild chimpanzees was not simple; it was the result of a lot of hard work and dedication.

Her interest in animals, especially chimpanzees, was further fuelled by Louis Leakey,  a Paleoanthropologist, who she met quite accidentally while holidaying in Nairobi. Leaky and his wife were studying human fossil fuels. When Leaky learnt about Janeâs extraordinary love for animals, especially chimpanzees , he was once keen to associate her with his work in the wild. And, when he learnt  that Jane had no formal training, he arranged to send her to London to study primates. After completing her study Goodall came back and worked in a wild where she set up to observe chimpanzee behaviour. She made interesting observations. One day she saw a chimp break off a twig, strip its bark and insert it inside it in a termite mound. When he withdrew the twig, it was covered with delicious termites which were readily licked. She also observed chimpanzees hunting, killing and even eating small colobus monkeys. 

In 1960, Jane reported chimpanzees using the blades of grass to fish out ants between the holes in the trunks of trees and dirt on the ground. Suddenly what had so far been considered a defining trait of humans only-- tool use and creation-- seemed to be challenged. Leaky, who had often faced naysayers, quipped excitedly in response, â Now we must redefine tool, redefine man, or accept chimpanzees as humansâ.

Suddenly, what had so far been considered - â**A defining traits **of humans only- tool used and creation --was challenged 

What does the highlighted terms mean?

Options



1. An inherited trait
2. A distinguishing trait
3. A common trait
4. An uncommon trait

## **Coding**

**Question 1:**

Particulate matters are the biggest contributors to Delhi pollution. The main reason behind the increase in the concentration of PMs include vehicle emission by applying Odd Even concept for all types of vehicles. The vehicles with the odd last digit in the registration number will be allowed on roads on odd dates and those with even last digit will on even dates.

Given an integer array a[], contains the last digit of the registration number of N vehicles traveling on date D(a positive integer). The task is to calculate the total fine collected by the traffic police department from the vehicles violating the rules.

Note : For violating the rule, vehicles would be fined as X Rs.

Example 1:

Input :

4 -> Value of N

{5,2,3,7} -> a[], Elements a[0] to a[N-1], during input each element is separated by a new line

12 -> Value of D, i.e. date 

200 -> Value of x i.e. fine

Output :

600  -> total fine collected 

Explanation:

Date D=12 means , only an even number of vehicles are allowed. 

Find will be collected from 5,3 and 7 with an amount of 200 each.

Hence, the output = 600.

Example 2:

Input :

5   -> Value of N 

{2,5,1,6,8}  -> a[], elements a[0] to a[N-1], during input each element is separated by new line

3 -> Value of D i.e. date 

300 -> Value of X i.e. fine 

Output :

900  -> total fine collected 

Explanation:

Date D=3 means only odd number vehicles with are allowed.

Find will be collected from 2,6 and 8 with an amount of 300 each.

Hence, the output = 900 

Constraints:

0&lt;N&lt;=100

1&lt;=a[i]&lt;=9

1&lt;=D &lt;=30

100&lt;=x&lt;=5000 

The input format for testing 

The candidate has to write the code to accept 4 input(s).

First input - Accept for N(Positive integer) values (a[]), where each value is separated by a new line.

Third input - Accept value for D(Positive integer)

Fourth input - Accept value for X(Positive integer )

The output format for testing 

The output should be a positive integer number (Check the output in Example 1, Example e) if no fine is collected then print â0â.

**Solution in Java :**

import java.util.*;

class Solution

{

   public static void main (String[]args)

   {

       Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);

       int n = sc.nextInt ();

       int arr[] = new int[n];

  

       for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)

           arr[i] = sc.nextInt ();

       int d = sc.nextInt ();

       int x = sc.nextInt ();

       int countEven = 0, countOdd = 0;

       for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)

       {

	        if (arr[i] % 2 == 0)

	            countEven++;

	        else

	            countOdd++;

       }

  

       if (d % 2 != 0)

       {

	        if (countEven == 0)

	            System.out.println ("0");

	        else

	            System.out.println (countEven * x);

       }

       else

       {

	        if (countOdd == 0)

	            System.out.println ("0");

	        else

	            System.out.println (countOdd * x);

       }

   }

}

**Question 2:**

In a puzzle game, there are five blocks. Each block is assigned with some repeating numbers 


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Block 1
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1     ------------->
<p>
9    â----------
<p>
       
   </td>
   <td>2----------------->
<p>
8 â---------------
<p>
10 --------------->
   </td>
   <td>3-------------->
<p>
7â------------
<p>
11------------->
   </td>
   <td>4--------------->
<p>
 6â------------
<p>
12-------------->  
<p>
So on                  
   </td>
   <td>5
<p>
13
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


The number 1 starts from block-1,2 on block-2,3 on block -3, 4 on block-4 and 5 on block-5. Again 6 on block-4 and so on.

Here we observe a pattern, the numbers 10,8 and 2 are on block-2 , 3,7 and 11 on the block 3 and so on. 

Given a positive integer N. The task is to find the correct block to which the number assigned.

Example 1:

Input :

3   ---> Value of N

Output :

3    -> Block number 

Example 2:

Input :

16    ---> Value of N

Output :

2    ---> Block number 

The input format for testing 

The candidate has to write the code to accept one input 

First input - Accept value for number of N (Positive integer number)

The output format for testing 

The output should be a positive integer (Check the output  in Example 1, Example 2)

**Solution in Java:**

import java.util.*;

class Solution

{

    public static void main(String[] args)

    {

              Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

              int n=sc.nextInt();

              int r=n%8;

              if(r==0)

                   System.out.println(2);

             else if(r&lt;5)

                  System.out.println(r);

             else

                  System.out.println(10-r);

    }

}
